  <h1>Untangle the Story</h1>

  <p>
    When everything feels overwhelming, it’s usually because facts,
    interpretations, and predictions are tangled together.
  </p>

  <hr style="margin: 2rem 0; opacity: 0.2;" />

  <h2>Step 1: What are the plain facts?</h2>
  <p>
    Only what has actually happened. No meaning attached.
  </p>

  <h2>Step 2: What story am I telling about it?</h2>
  <p>
    What assumptions, fears, or conclusions have I added?
  </p>

  <h2>Step 3: What am I predicting?</h2>
  <p>
    What future outcome am I imagining — and how certain is it really?
  </p>

  <hr style="margin: 2rem 0; opacity: 0.2;" />

  <p>
    Often, separating these three reduces emotional intensity by half.

    If you are at risk of harm or in immediate danger, contact local emergency services.
    This is structure, not treatment.
