  <h1>One-Minute Reset</h1>

  <p>
    This takes sixty seconds. Nothing mystical. No affirmations required.

  <hr style="margin: 2rem 0; opacity: 0.2;" />

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Look around.</strong> Name five things you can see.</li>
    <li><strong>Feel your feet.</strong> Press them gently into the floor.</li>
    <li><strong>Slow your breathing.</strong> In for four. Hold for four. Out for six.</li>
    <li><strong>Loosen your jaw and shoulders.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Ask:</strong> What actually needs doing in the next ten minutes?</li>
  </ol>

  <hr style="margin: 2rem 0; opacity: 0.2;" />

  <p>
    Not the whole day. Not your life. Just the next small, concrete step.
  </p>

    If you are at risk of harm or in immediate danger, contact local emergency services.
    This is structure, not treatment.
