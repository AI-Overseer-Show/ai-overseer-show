  <h1>Next Small Step</h1>

  <p>
    When everything feels too large, don’t solve the whole thing.
    Reduce it.
  </p>

  <hr style="margin: 2rem 0; opacity: 0.2;" />

  <h2>1. What is the smallest useful action?</h2>
  <p>
    Not the perfect action. Not the final solution.
    Just the next physically possible step.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Can I do it in under five minutes?</h2>
  <p>
    If not, shrink it again.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Do only that.</h2>
  <p>
    Momentum is built by completion, not intensity.
  </p>

  <hr style="margin: 2rem 0; opacity: 0.2;" />

  <p>
    After one small step, reassess.
    Then take the next.
  </p>

  <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; opacity: 0.7;">
    If you are at risk of harm or in immediate danger, contact local emergency services.
    This is structure, not treatment.
